One subclass, called convolutional SPNs (CSPNs), can beimplemented using tensors, but also can suffer from being too shallow. Fortunately, tensors can be augmented while maintaining valid SPNs. This yields a larger subclass of CNNs, which we call deep convolutional SPNs (DCSPNs), where the convolutional and sum-pooling layers form rich directed acyclic graph structures. One salient feature of DCSPNs is that they are a rigorous probabilistic model. As such, they can exploit multiple kinds of probabilistic reasoning, including marginal inference and most probable explanation (MPE) inference. This allows an alternative method for learning DCSPNs using vectorized differentiable MPE, which plays a similar role to the generator in generative adversarial networks (GANs). Image sampling is yet another application demonstrating the robustness of DCSPNs. Our preliminary results on image sampling are encouraging, since the DCSPN sampled images exhibit variability. Experiments on image completion show that DCSPNs significantly outperform competing methods by achieving several state-of-the-art mean squared error (MSE) scores in both left-completion and bottom-completion in benchmark datasets.","tags":null,"title":"Deep Convolutional Sum-Product Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["A.L.

We establish the correctness of SP. The striking feature of SP is that its message construction exploits the factorization of potentials at a sending node, but without the overhead of building and examining graphs as done in Lazy Propagation (LP). Experimental results on optimal (or close to optimal) join trees built from numerous benchmark Bayesian networks show that SP is often faster than LP.","tags":null,"title":"An Empirical Study of Bayesian Network Inference with Simple Propagation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.J.
