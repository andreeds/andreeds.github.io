## OpenStreetMap and AnyPlace


We could find two open source options that we considered viable for a real world implementation: [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and [AnyPlace](http://anyplace.cs.ucy.ac.cy/). I would be very hard to adapt that client in order to run a customized mapping made at the UofR. This required workload may not pay off for this prototype.
