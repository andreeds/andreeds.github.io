The evaluation of the AC and computing the partial derivatives is a two-phase message passing scheme in which each message is simply a number. The first phase, massages are sent from nodes to their parents in the AC following the operations of each node. The phase starts from the leaves up to the root. 

I have shown how a parallel solution can be implemented and described how it compares to a serial solution. 

The limitations to the solutions are essentially imposed by topological ordering only.
