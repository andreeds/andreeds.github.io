A join work with [Mr. Jhonatan Oliveira](https://github.com/jhonatanoliveira) in a **low cost terminal information system**.
The idea here is to have a **compact** and **cheap** terminal available for students at any point of the University of Regina campus.
This terminal should be able to handle, initially, 2 kinds of information: localization and contact info.
Here, the goal will be to show the student how to get somewhere at the university or what is the phone number of a staff member.
The project itself will be available in a github repository too.

Link will be posted later.
