## AnyPlace


[Anyplace](http://anyplace.cs.ucy.ac.cy/) is an open source alternative for indoor navigation. The problem was with creating the layer over Google Maps to show all of our required information. This is done within the Viewer and we tried to understand from there, but they used a different framework (angular.js) for implementing this task, while we use Meteor.js. That is, we could not use their solution in our application.
