The last paper submitted was on The Paper - Task A.
The paper is called [A Differential Approach to Inference in Bayesian Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3847).

The paper is the first of many published articles to present the idea of compiled Bayesian Networks (Darwiche, 2003; Chavira et al., 2006; Park and Darwiche, 2004; Chavira and Darwiche, 2007). It is also has been sum up as an important part of his book “Modeling and Reasoning with Bayesian Networks” (2009). The paper was published on the Proceedings of the Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI). UAI is yet today the leading conference of the field and is annually hold in the USA. Some of its notorious sponsors are Google, Microsoft Research and Facebook.

Darwiche proposes a new approach for inference in Bayesian networks based on partial differentiation. Its first step is compiling the BN into a polynomial. Then, it computes the partial derivatives of this polynomial with respect to each variables. The partial derivatives are important when estimating BN parameters and when performing sensitivity analysis. Moreover, with the derivatives it is possible to compute in constant- time answers to a large class of probabilistic queries.

The paper has a mathematical heavy notation and it is not a easy reading. More of my critique on the paper ;)...
