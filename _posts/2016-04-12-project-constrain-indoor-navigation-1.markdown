title: Project constrain - indoor navigation [1]

## Insoft and InDoors

We did a broad research on publicly available solutions for indoor navigation, including paid, free or open source ones. For the commercial options, the most accessible options that we found was [Insoft](
     http://www.infsoft.com/) and [InDoors](http://indoo.rs/). The disadvantage of them is the price which might be expensive for small projects/companies and the use of specialized hardware to operate in full potential.
