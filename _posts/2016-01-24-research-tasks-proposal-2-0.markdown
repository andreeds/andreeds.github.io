Given the thoughtful insights given by Mr. Gerhard via email (listed below),

>Hi Andre, 
>
>I had a quick look at this, and in general it's OK and a good start.  I'd make two suggestions:
>- for "the paper", you need to find a research paper, focussed on parallel, embedded or cloud.  I don't think pen tablets counts for this.  Have a look a little deeper. 
>- for "the problem", baysean network inference is quite a broad topic. I'd suggest trying to narrow it down to a specific problem within BN, mostly because I suspect others will also be interest in work in in BN. 
 >- for "the past/the future" I'm wanting people to look at ore- or post-silicon computing, and examine the inherent constraints therein.  The pebble smartwatch is firmly planted in the silicon era. Think 50 years ago or 50 years from now.

>Everything else looks good.   

the following adjustment to the proposal were made:

##A: The Paper

\* Yet to decide

##B: The Platform 

###A application of [**wit.ai**][wit]

##C: The Problem 

###**Baysian Network (BN) inference:  Efficient implementation of a factor product operation**

Implementation of the Algorithm 10.A.1 of the book [Probabilistic graphical models: principles and techniques (Koller and Friedman 2009)] [koll] 

##D: The Comparison

###**Peforming BN inference with Python using CUDA**

##E: The Future / The Past 

###**The future of simulation with the evolution of computers and its implications**

A overview of leading post-silicon advanced computing platforms and how they relate with the paradox presented by [Dr. Nick Bostrom, from Oxford University][sim].
