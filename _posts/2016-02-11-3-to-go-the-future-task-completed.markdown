title: 3 to go... The Future Task completed
layout: post
---
The last paper submitted was on The Past/the Future - Task E.
My topic was on  quantum computers (QC). But wait!... What I explored, differently from my colleagues, was the impact of QC in the future.
QC will be fast, but so what?
I research about the limitations of QC and also a very interesting implication.
Maybe, due to the powerful computing sources available in the future, we might be living in a simulation right now!
I connected this whole philosophical and theoretical constraints of QC in the future.
The result was a nice paper. I liked it.
