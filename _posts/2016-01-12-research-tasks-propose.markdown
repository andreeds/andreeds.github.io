# A: The Paper

###**Pen tablets and Drawing Desks**

- Operation systems.
- Pressure sensitivity.
- Application with [Wacom][wac] Drawing Desk.
- [Wireless Accessory Kit.][wacwigi]

#B: The Platform 

###[**wit.ai**][wit]

- Turn speech or text into actionable data. 
- Natural Language for Developers . 
- Recentely [bought][bit] by Facebook.com

>The Wit.ai product lets developers add a few lines of its code to instantly build in speech recognition and voice control. Without it, developers would need the expertise, time and resources to build a whole voice-recognition system themselves.

#C: The Problem 

###**Baysian Network (BN) inference**

> "Once you've got hold of a Bayesian Network, there remains the question of how you do inference with it. Inference is the operation in which some subset of the attributes are given to us with known values, and we must use the Bayes net to estimate the probability distribution of one or more of the remaining attributes. A typical use of inference is "I've got a temperature of 101, I'm a 37-year-old Male and my tongue feels kind of funny but I have no headache. What's the chance that I've got bubonic plague?" [(Andrew Moore)][ambn].

#D: The Comparison

###**Peforming BN inference with Python using CUDA**

#E: The Future / The Past 

###[**Pebble Classic Smartwatch**][peb]

>The Pebble E-Paper Watch is a smartwatch developed by Pebble Technology and released in 2013. The project is under continued development and funded by Kickstarter contributors. [Source][scpb]
