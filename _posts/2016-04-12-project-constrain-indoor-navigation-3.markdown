## Final decision


The initial plan for our final project included a service inside the app for indoor navigation. The idea was to allow the user to ask for a location within the University of Regina (UofR) main campus and the app would trace a route from where the device hosting the app is to where the user requested. Indoor navigation itself is a complex and well known task problem in computer science and engineering.

We decided to **do not go further with the indoor navigation** due to its complexity requirements for implementation. This can be motivation for future works in this project. Indeed, our current application is **flexible enough** for incorporating any third part services, including indoor navigation.
