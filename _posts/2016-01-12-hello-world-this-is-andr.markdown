This is will be the blog. Here, my weekly activity will be recorded fro CS 807. 
Interactive Hardware and Embedded Computing (CS 807) is a Graduate level course taught by Dr. Gerhard at the [University of Regina][uofr]. As described in the class syllabus, the studies will be on:
> Hardware design for physical and pervasive computing systems. 
> Wired and wireless communication protocols; sensors and actuators; resource constraints; location- and context-awareness. 
> Applications include: wearable computing, wireless sensor networks, robotics and automation, internet of things. 
> Embedded hardware platforms such as ARM (raspberry Pi) and AVR (Arduino)."

As previously mentioned, here all activities involving the application or theoretical tasks will be documented in this blog. Practical exercises with programming will be register on the Version Control System (VLC) Github. The access on my Github profile will be made accessible by [this link][gha].
