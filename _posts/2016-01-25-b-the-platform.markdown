For this task I will be utilizing the cloud service [**wit.ai**][wit]. It is used for turning speech or text into actionable data. It is a tool for working with natural Language for Developers.
Wit has been recentely [bought][bit] by Facebook.com

I will use the [guideline][gui] provided by Wit. To go a little bit further, I will use the output of Wit to perform changes on the html code on the fly.

Wit requires training. It needs to recognize the voice. This steps will be clearly declared on the project to be submitted.

### UPDATE 1

My ideia, to go a little further of the simple "Hello World!" is to train the app to identify colours. Given the value of the colour, the change the "fill" attribute of a *\<svg\>* on the fly.

### UPDATE 2

The code is working. Command the object to change its colour works. I still have the paper to finish writing and prepere the presentation.
