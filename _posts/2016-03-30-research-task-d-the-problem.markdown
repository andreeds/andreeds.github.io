There are two phases to compile the AC: upward and inward. In this paper we presented the algorithm to compile the AC, drawn from Darwiche (2009). 

I implemented a parallel solution and compared to a serial solution. 

The experimental results indicate that the parallel solution is  effective in ACs (about 4 times faster). 

It was noticed that different elimination ordering of variables upon the construction of the AC can influence on the compilation time.
